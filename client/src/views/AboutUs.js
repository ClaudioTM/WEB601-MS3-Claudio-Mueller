            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>The team here at Tasman Tramping are a group of tramping enthusiasts who love the outdoors and nature. We passed by the Tasman region a few years ago when we were travelling across the South Island, and absolutely fell in love with the beauty of the region. We decided to move here, and due to our passion for tramping and nature, we decided to make Tasman Tramping to create a platform where people can discuss the tracks in the area and to make the information more accessible to the public.</p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>We are originally from the Netherlands, and come from a long line of tramping fanatics. We immigrating to New Zealand in 1995 and lived near Taupo on the North Island for about 15 years. As we travelled around New Zealand, walking every track we could find, we finally came across Tasman. We were amazed by the beauty of the region. With the Kahurangi National Park, Abel Tasman, and the Richmond Ranges, we felt like we had found our tramping paradise. We decided to quit everything we were doing and move to Tasman in the hopes of a better quality of life surrounded by nature.</p>
